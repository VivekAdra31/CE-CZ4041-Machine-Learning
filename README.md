The EDA, Pre-processing and feature engineering, and all models code can be found inside the folder "Code"

The Pre - processing and Feature Engineering notebook "Feature_Engineering_Notebook" reads the train and test data, conducts pre - processing and feature engineering, and outputs 4 files - 
Two train and test files that still have some missing values, and 
Two train and test files that have imputed values. 

All the models used in the project use either two of these four files.
